                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>The company's mission is its overall purpose for existing. For example, a company may have a mission of changing the world, helping the poor or creating more sustainable business practices within a certain industry. Mission statements are typically action-oriented statements that are brief but powerful and help outline what the company hopes to accomplish.</p>

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>The company's vision is its future view of the industry and itself. It contains the company's goals for the business, its employees and customers, along with its place in the world. A vision statement looks to the future and helps create a mental image of what the ideal business looks like. Businesses use vision statements to outline goals and appeal to talent within the industry that can help them reach those goals.</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>A company's values are the core principles that help guide it toward its vision and help it complete the mission. For example, a company that sees itself going carbon negative within ten years may embody the values of sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint. The company values act as a moral guideline for the behaviors and actions of the business and its employees.</p>

            <p>To develop transformative learning experiences that simultaneously build capacity while also generating a user-friendly product is not a clear cut process. We balance creativity and analysis and use an iterative learning-by-doing process (Cravens, et.al, 2014)with clients to support innovation.</p>
